## Project Overview

This project implements a high-performance, distributed risk engine for real-time monitoring of crypto derivatives trading. The system is designed to operate at low latency with fault-tolerant stream processing, providing up-to-the-second calculations of key financial risk metrics such as exposure, unrealized PnL, margin requirements, and liquidation thresholds. Built with modern infrastructure tools and a performance-oriented backend, the system is suitable for high-frequency trading and institutional risk management.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

- Rust: High-performance engine for safe, concurrent computations
- Kafka: Distributed event streaming platform for ingesting real-time trade/order data
- TimescaleDB: Scalable, time-series database for risk snapshots and historical analysis
- Grafana: Visualization dashboard for real-time risk metrics and alerts

## Key Features

- Real-time ingestion of crypto order book and trade data
- Distributed processing pipeline using Kafka topics and consumer groups
- Modular architecture for adding risk metrics (VaR, Delta, PnL, etc.)
- Historical and time-windowed risk aggregation using TimescaleDB
- Real-time alerting and visualization through Grafana dashboards

---

## Use Cases

- Crypto trading desk risk monitoring
- Backtesting of derivatives risk models
- Margin engine integration for trading platforms
- Real-time exposure tracking for multi-asset portfolios

---

## Limitations & Future Work

- Integrate multi-asset netting logic for correlated exposure analysis
- Extend support for perpetual swaps, futures, and options
- Add persistent fault tolerance for Kafka consumers
- Enhance risk alerting logic with anomaly detection or rule-based thresholds
- Optimize latency-critical paths via async batching and in-Rust caching layers
